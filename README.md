Python: Dijkstra as a greedy approach for finding the shortest route (O(|R|log|L|) Feb 2023 - July 2023 
Reconstruct the shortest route from all the combination of the lanes by Dijkstra and backtracking
• Mirror world to deal with the problem of whether riding on fast-lane by taking friends with detouring or slow-lane alone.
• MinHeap to reduce the computation complexity of serving the current closest node (shortest route) to travel.
• Backtracking to reconstruct existing route and recalculate the length if the route leads to the starting point (cycle occurs).

Python: Dynamic Programming for overall optimal route with lowest total occupancy probability O(NM)
Reconstruct overall optimal route from combinations of different starts and ends by dynamic programming and backtracking.
