#Assignment2
def select_sections(occupancy_probability):
    """
    Written by LIANG DIZHEN

    Function: select_sections go through the matrix of occupancy_probability to get the minimum
    total occupancy_probability and return as one item in the return list with another lsit item
    consist of route from the start to end that has a minimum total occupancy_probability

    Approach
    Using dynamic programming concept to start from multiple ends and calculate the total occupancy probability
    from multiple ends individually to until multiple start points by going through possible routes
    and see which start has the minimum occupancy probability and the route that has a minimum total
    occupancy_probability.
    By doing so, we need to create another matrix (dp matrix) to store the previous position tuple into the current
    position of the dp matrix. At the beginning we just store the (None, None) position tuple into the
    dp[0][j](all elements in the first row). After that, we start to loop through the op (occupancy_probability) matrix
    from n = 1 (second row) until last row to update accumulate the total minimum occupancy probability
    by comparing the possible values in the previous row (end row in this case) choose the minimum one among
    them to add with value in the current position to get the sum to store in the current position of the dp.

    For this situation, there are multiple cases that would happen
    For the matrix when m = 1 (matrix that one column), only top value (value on top of it) is possible
    For the value in column when m = 0, it only has top value  and the
    right diagonal value (value is right and on top of it) to choose
    For the value in column when m = 0, it only has top value (value on top of it) and the
    right diagonal value (value is right and on top of it) to choose)
    For the value in column when m = m-1, it only has top value (value on top of it) and the
    left diagonal value (value is left and on top of it) to choose

    When the whole procedure is finished, we will end up with a matrix full of the previous position tuples stored
    inside the dp matrix and the elements last row (multiple start elements) have the total occupancy probability
    in op matrix.

    Then use for loop to find out the one with the lowest probability, and its correspond position is conveted to a list
    item that has itself, then dp_ret just point on this
    Its corresponding position in the op matrix then use it on the dp matrix to get the previous position tuple in the
    dp matrix. There is where the Backtracking comes in, Backtracking would do repeat the previous line of procedures
    until the position tuple is (None, None) tuple and indicate where we reach the end rows
    While the Backtracking is working, it would reconstruct the route (dp_ret return list) based on the previous
    position tuples by adding them one by one to the dp_ret list. Once this is done, it will be passed to the
    reverse function that is written by myself to correct its order inside the list and add the minimum total occupancy
    value into the front of the list

    Precondition: there must be a minimum total occupancy probability and the route that consists of position tuple
    occupancy_probability at least must be a matrix that has n = 2 (at least 2 row hence m = 1 has 1 column to be a matrix)
    since n > m specified in the assignment and the occupancy probability of this element + the only end value
    would sum up to be the occupancy probability and the route consists of only these two values' corresponding
    position tuples

    Postcondition: second item in the dp_ret return list should not be (None,None)

    Input:
    occupancy_probability: matrix of occupancy probability
